+Aspeed AST25XX and AST26XX XDMA Engine
+
+The XDMA Engine embedded in the AST2500 and AST2600 SOCs can perform automatic
+DMA operations over PCI between the SOC (acting as a BMC) and a host processor.
+
+Required properties:
+ - compatible		: must be "aspeed,ast2500-xdma" or
+			  "aspeed,ast2600-xdma"
+ - reg			: contains the address and size of the memory region
+			  associated with the XDMA engine registers
+ - clocks		: clock specifier for the clock associated with the
+			  XDMA engine
+ - resets		: reset specifier for the syscon reset associated with
+			  the XDMA engine
+ - interrupts-extended	: two interrupt nodes; the first specifies the global
+			  interrupt for the XDMA engine and the second
+			  specifies the PCI-E reset or PERST interrupt.
+ - scu			: a phandle to the syscon node for the system control
+			  unit of the SOC
+ - sdmc			: a phandle to the syscon node for the SDRAM memory
+			  controller of the SOC
+ - vga-mem		: contains the address and size of the VGA memory space
+			  to be used by the XDMA engine
+
+Optional properties:
+ - pcie-device		: should be either "bmc" or "vga", corresponding to
+			  which device should be used by the XDMA engine for
+			  DMA operations. If this property is not set, the XDMA
+			  engine will use the BMC PCI-E device.
+
+Example:
+
+    xdma@1e6e7000 {
+        compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-xdma";
+        reg = <0x1e6e7000 0x100>;
+        clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_BCLK>;
+        resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_XDMA>;
+        interrupts-extended = <&vic 6>, <&scu_ic ASPEED_AST2500_SCU_IC_PCIE_RESET_LO_TO_HI>;
+        scu = <&syscon>;
+        sdmc = <&edac>;
+        pcie-device = "bmc";
+        vga-mem = <0x9f000000 0x01000000>;
+    };
