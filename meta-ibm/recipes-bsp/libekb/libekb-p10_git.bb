# During compilation race condition issue is happening, so getting different
# different error due to make targets rule dependency ( mostly found auto code generation ).
# Hence, forcing this recipe to run make tool with single job
# instead in multi-job which is control by bitbake based on cpu.
# TODO ibm/openbmc/issues/278 : Actual fix should be in libekb makefile.
# Need to revisit once fixed in libekb makefile
